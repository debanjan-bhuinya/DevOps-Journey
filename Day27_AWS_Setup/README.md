# Day 27: AWS Account Setup & Security 🛡️

##  Milestones
1. **AWS Account Created**: Successfully signed up for the Free Tier.
2. **Root User Secured**: Enabled MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) using Google Authenticator.
3. **Budget Alarm Set**: Configured a "Zero Spend Budget" to get email alerts if costs exceed $0.01.

## Key Learnings
- Never use the Root user for daily tasks (coming soon).
- Regions matter (Selected `ap-south-1` Mumbai).
