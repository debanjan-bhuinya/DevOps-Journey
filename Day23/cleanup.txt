Day 23 - Docker Cleanup

1. docker ps -a           -> List ALL containers (running + stopped)
2. docker rm [id]         -> Delete a specific container
3. docker container prune -> Delete ALL stopped containers
4. docker rmi [image]     -> Delete an image (blueprint)
5. docker system prune    -> Delete EVERYTHING (unused images, networks, cache)
